# A Few Words
Configuring my computer from scratch is time consuming and tedious so I decided to automate this process. The configuration stored in this repo represents personal settings and it may not be for everyone. Please, if you don't know what are you doing, stop here. If you run these scripts it may cause problems that you may not be aware of how to recover from.
